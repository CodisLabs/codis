# If proxy don't send a heartbeat in timeout millisecond which is usually because proxy has high load or even no response, zk will mark this proxy offline.
# A higher timeout will recude the possibility of "session expired" but clients will not know the proxy has no response in time if the proxy is down indeed.
# So we highly recommend you not to change this default timeout and use Jodis(https://github.com/CodisLabs/jodis)
# which watches the available proxies and will skip the offline proxy or add new online proxy automatically.
# If you are not using Java in client, you can DIY a zk watcher accourding to Jodis source code.
