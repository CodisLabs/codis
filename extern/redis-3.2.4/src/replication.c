/* Try a partial resynchronization with the master if we are about to reconnect.
 * If there is no cached master structure, at least try to issue a
 * "PSYNC ? -1" command in order to trigger a full resync using the PSYNC
 * command in order to obtain the master run id and the master replication
 * global offset.
 *
 * This function is designed to be called from syncWithMaster(), so the
 * following assumptions are made:
 *
 * 1) We pass the function an already connected socket "fd".
 * 2) This function does not close the file descriptor "fd". However in case
 *    of successful partial resynchronization, the function will reuse
 *    'fd' as file descriptor of the server.master client structure.
 *
 * The function is split in two halves: if read_reply is 0, the function
 * writes the PSYNC command on the socket, and a new function call is
 * needed, with read_reply set to 1, in order to read the reply of the
 * command. This is useful in order to support non blocking operations, so
 * that we write, return into the event loop, and read when there are data.
 *
 * When read_reply is 0 the function returns PSYNC_WRITE_ERR if there
 * was a write error, or PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY to signal we need another call
 * with read_reply set to 1. However even when read_reply is set to 1
 * the function may return PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY again to signal there were
 * insufficient data to read to complete its work. We should re-enter
 * into the event loop and wait in such a case.
 *
 * The function returns:
 *
 * PSYNC_CONTINUE: If the PSYNC command succeded and we can continue.
 * PSYNC_FULLRESYNC: If PSYNC is supported but a full resync is needed.
 *                   In this case the master run_id and global replication
 *                   offset is saved.
 * PSYNC_NOT_SUPPORTED: If the server does not understand PSYNC at all and
 *                      the caller should fall back to SYNC.
 * PSYNC_WRITE_ERR: There was an error writing the command to the socket.
 * PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY: Call again the function with read_reply set to 1.
 *
 * Notable side effects:
 *
 * 1) As a side effect of the function call the function removes the readable
 *    event handler from "fd", unless the return value is PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY.
 * 2) server.repl_master_initial_offset is set to the right value according
 *    to the master reply. This will be used to populate the 'server.master'
 *    structure replication offset.

/* ----------------------- REPLICATION SCRIPT CACHE --------------------------
 * The goal of this code is to keep track of scripts already sent to every
 * connected slave, in order to be able to replicate EVALSHA as it is without
 * translating it to EVAL every time it is possible.
 *
 * We use a capped collection implemented by a hash table for fast lookup
 * of scripts we can send as EVALSHA, plus a linked list that is used for
 * eviction of the oldest entry when the max number of items is reached.
 *
 * We don't care about taking a different cache for every different slave
 * since to fill the cache again is not very costly, the goal of this code
 * is to avoid that the same big script is trasmitted a big number of times
 * per second wasting bandwidth and processor speed, but it is not a problem
 * if we need to rebuild the cache from scratch from time to time, every used
 * script will need to be transmitted a single time to reappear in the cache.
 *
 * This is how the system works:
 *
 * 1) Every time a new slave connects, we flush the whole script cache.
 * 2) We only send as EVALSHA what was sent to the master as EVALSHA, without
 *    trying to convert EVAL into EVALSHA specifically for slaves.
 * 3) Every time we trasmit a script as EVAL to the slaves, we also add the
 *    corresponding SHA1 of the script into the cache as we are sure every
 *    slave knows about the script starting from now.
 * 4) On SCRIPT FLUSH command, we replicate the command to all the slaves
 *    and at the same time flush the script cache.
 * 5) When the last slave disconnects, flush the cache.
 * 6) We handle SCRIPT LOAD as well since that's how scripts are loaded
 *    in the master sometimes.

/* ----------------------- SYNCHRONOUS REPLICATION --------------------------
 * Redis synchronous replication design can be summarized in points:
 *
 * - Redis masters have a global replication offset, used by PSYNC.
 * - Master increment the offset every time new commands are sent to slaves.
 * - Slaves ping back masters with the offset processed so far.
 *
 * So synchronous replication adds a new WAIT command in the form:
 *
 *   WAIT <num_replicas> <milliseconds_timeout>
 *
 * That returns the number of replicas that processed the query when
 * we finally have at least num_replicas, or when the timeout was
 * reached.
 *
 * The command is implemented in this way:
 *
 * - Every time a client processes a command, we remember the replication
 *   offset after sending that command to the slaves.
 * - When WAIT is called, we ask slaves to send an acknowledgement ASAP.
 *   The client is blocked at the same time (see blocked.c).
 * - Once we receive enough ACKs for a given offset or when the timeout
 *   is reached, the WAIT command is unblocked and the reply sent to the
 *   client.
