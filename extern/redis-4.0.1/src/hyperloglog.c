/* The Redis HyperLogLog implementation is based on the following ideas:
 *
 * * The use of a 64 bit hash function as proposed in [1], in order to don't
 *   limited to cardinalities up to 10^9, at the cost of just 1 additional
 *   bit per register.
 * * The use of 16384 6-bit registers for a great level of accuracy, using
 *   a total of 12k per key.
 * * The use of the Redis string data type. No new type is introduced.
 * * No attempt is made to compress the data structure as in [1]. Also the
 *   algorithm used is the original HyperLogLog Algorithm as in [2], with
 *   the only difference that a 64 bit hash function is used, so no correction
 *   is performed for values near 2^32 as in [1].
 *
 * [1] Heule, Nunkesser, Hall: HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic
 *     Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm.
 *
 * [2] P. Flajolet, Ã‰ric Fusy, O. Gandouet, and F. Meunier. Hyperloglog: The
 *     analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm.
 *
 * Redis uses two representations:
 *
 * 1) A "dense" representation where every entry is represented by
 *    a 6-bit integer.
 * 2) A "sparse" representation using run length compression suitable
 *    for representing HyperLogLogs with many registers set to 0 in
 *    a memory efficient way.
 *
 *
 * HLL header
 * ===
 *
 * Both the dense and sparse representation have a 16 byte header as follows:
 *
 * +------+---+-----+----------+
 * | HYLL | E | N/U | Cardin.  |
 * +------+---+-----+----------+
 *
 * The first 4 bytes are a magic string set to the bytes "HYLL".
 * "E" is one byte encoding, currently set to HLL_DENSE or
 * HLL_SPARSE. N/U are three not used bytes.
 *
 * The "Cardin." field is a 64 bit integer stored in little endian format
 * with the latest cardinality computed that can be reused if the data
 * structure was not modified since the last computation (this is useful
 * because there are high probabilities that HLLADD operations don't
 * modify the actual data structure and hence the approximated cardinality).
 *
 * When the most significant bit in the most significant byte of the cached
 * cardinality is set, it means that the data structure was modified and
 * we can't reuse the cached value that must be recomputed.
 *
 * Dense representation
 * ===
 *
 * The dense representation used by Redis is the following:
 *
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//      //--+
 * |11000000|22221111|33333322|55444444 ....     |
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//      //--+
 *
 * The 6 bits counters are encoded one after the other starting from the
 * LSB to the MSB, and using the next bytes as needed.
 *
 * Sparse representation
 * ===
 *
 * The sparse representation encodes registers using a run length
 * encoding composed of three opcodes, two using one byte, and one using
 * of two bytes. The opcodes are called ZERO, XZERO and VAL.
 *
 * ZERO opcode is represented as 00xxxxxx. The 6-bit integer represented
 * by the six bits 'xxxxxx', plus 1, means that there are N registers set
 * to 0. This opcode can represent from 1 to 64 contiguous registers set
 * to the value of 0.
 *
 * XZERO opcode is represented by two bytes 01xxxxxx yyyyyyyy. The 14-bit
 * integer represented by the bits 'xxxxxx' as most significant bits and
 * 'yyyyyyyy' as least significant bits, plus 1, means that there are N
 * registers set to 0. This opcode can represent from 0 to 16384 contiguous
 * registers set to the value of 0.
 *
 * VAL opcode is represented as 1vvvvvxx. It contains a 5-bit integer
 * representing the value of a register, and a 2-bit integer representing
 * the number of contiguous registers set to that value 'vvvvv'.
 * To obtain the value and run length, the integers vvvvv and xx must be
 * incremented by one. This opcode can represent values from 1 to 32,
 * repeated from 1 to 4 times.
 *
 * The sparse representation can't represent registers with a value greater
 * than 32, however it is very unlikely that we find such a register in an
 * HLL with a cardinality where the sparse representation is still more
 * memory efficient than the dense representation. When this happens the
 * HLL is converted to the dense representation.
 *
 * The sparse representation is purely positional. For example a sparse
 * representation of an empty HLL is just: XZERO:16384.
 *
 * An HLL having only 3 non-zero registers at position 1000, 1020, 1021
 * respectively set to 2, 3, 3, is represented by the following three
 * opcodes:
 *
 * XZERO:1000 (Registers 0-999 are set to 0)
 * VAL:2,1    (1 register set to value 2, that is register 1000)
 * ZERO:19    (Registers 1001-1019 set to 0)
 * VAL:3,2    (2 registers set to value 3, that is registers 1020,1021)
 * XZERO:15362 (Registers 1022-16383 set to 0)
 *
 * In the example the sparse representation used just 7 bytes instead
 * of 12k in order to represent the HLL registers. In general for low
 * cardinality there is a big win in terms of space efficiency, traded
 * with CPU time since the sparse representation is slower to access:
 *
 * The following table shows average cardinality vs bytes used, 100
 * samples per cardinality (when the set was not representable because
 * of registers with too big value, the dense representation size was used
 * as a sample).
 *
 * 100 267
 * 200 485
 * 300 678
 * 400 859
 * 500 1033
 * 600 1205
 * 700 1375
 * 800 1544
 * 900 1713
 * 1000 1882
 * 2000 3480
 * 3000 4879
 * 4000 6089
 * 5000 7138
 * 6000 8042
 * 7000 8823
 * 8000 9500
 * 9000 10088
 * 10000 10591
 *
 * The dense representation uses 12288 bytes, so there is a big win up to
 * a cardinality of ~2000-3000. For bigger cardinalities the constant times
 * involved in updating the sparse representation is not justified by the
 * memory savings. The exact maximum length of the sparse representation
 * when this implementation switches to the dense representation is
 * configured via the define server.hll_sparse_max_bytes.

/* =========================== Low level bit macros ========================= */

/* Macros to access the dense representation.
 *
 * We need to get and set 6 bit counters in an array of 8 bit bytes.
 * We use macros to make sure the code is inlined since speed is critical
 * especially in order to compute the approximated cardinality in
 * HLLCOUNT where we need to access all the registers at once.
 * For the same reason we also want to avoid conditionals in this code path.
 *
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//
 * |11000000|22221111|33333322|55444444
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//
 *
 * Note: in the above representation the most significant bit (MSB)
 * of every byte is on the left. We start using bits from the LSB to MSB,
 * and so forth passing to the next byte.
 *
 * Example, we want to access to counter at pos = 1 ("111111" in the
 * illustration above).
 *
 * The index of the first byte b0 containing our data is:
 *
 *  b0 = 6 * pos / 8 = 0
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11000000|  <- Our byte at b0
 *   +--------+
 *
 * The position of the first bit (counting from the LSB = 0) in the byte
 * is given by:
 *
 *  fb = 6 * pos % 8 -> 6
 *
 * Right shift b0 of 'fb' bits.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11000000|  <- Initial value of b0
 *   |00000011|  <- After right shift of 6 pos.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Left shift b1 of bits 8-fb bits (2 bits)
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |22221111|  <- Initial value of b1
 *   |22111100|  <- After left shift of 2 bits.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * OR the two bits, and finally AND with 111111 (63 in decimal) to
 * clean the higher order bits we are not interested in:
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |00000011|  <- b0 right shifted
 *   |22111100|  <- b1 left shifted
 *   |22111111|  <- b0 OR b1
 *   |  111111|  <- (b0 OR b1) AND 63, our value.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * We can try with a different example, like pos = 0. In this case
 * the 6-bit counter is actually contained in a single byte.
 *
 *  b0 = 6 * pos / 8 = 0
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11000000|  <- Our byte at b0
 *   +--------+
 *
 *  fb = 6 * pos % 8 = 0
 *
 *  So we right shift of 0 bits (no shift in practice) and
 *  left shift the next byte of 8 bits, even if we don't use it,
 *  but this has the effect of clearing the bits so the result
 *  will not be affacted after the OR.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Setting the register is a bit more complex, let's assume that 'val'
 * is the value we want to set, already in the right range.
 *
 * We need two steps, in one we need to clear the bits, and in the other
 * we need to bitwise-OR the new bits.
 *
 * Let's try with 'pos' = 1, so our first byte at 'b' is 0,
 *
 * "fb" is 6 in this case.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11000000|  <- Our byte at b0
 *   +--------+
 *
 * To create a AND-mask to clear the bits about this position, we just
 * initialize the mask with the value 63, left shift it of "fs" bits,
 * and finally invert the result.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |00111111|  <- "mask" starts at 63
 *   |11000000|  <- "mask" after left shift of "ls" bits.
 *   |00111111|  <- "mask" after invert.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Now we can bitwise-AND the byte at "b" with the mask, and bitwise-OR
 * it with "val" left-shifted of "ls" bits to set the new bits.
 *
 * Now let's focus on the next byte b1:
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |22221111|  <- Initial value of b1
 *   +--------+
 *
 * To build the AND mask we start again with the 63 value, right shift
 * it by 8-fb bits, and invert it.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |00111111|  <- "mask" set at 2&6-1
 *   |00001111|  <- "mask" after the right shift by 8-fb = 2 bits
 *   |11110000|  <- "mask" after bitwise not.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Now we can mask it with b+1 to clear the old bits, and bitwise-OR
 * with "val" left-shifted by "rs" bits to set the new value.
