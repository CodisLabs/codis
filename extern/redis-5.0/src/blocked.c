 *
 * API:
 *
 * getTimeoutFromObjectOrReply() is just an utility function to parse a
 * timeout argument since blocking operations usually require a timeout.
 *
 * blockClient() set the CLIENT_BLOCKED flag in the client, and set the
 * specified block type 'btype' filed to one of BLOCKED_* macros.
 *
 * unblockClient() unblocks the client doing the following:
 * 1) It calls the btype-specific function to cleanup the state.
 * 2) It unblocks the client by unsetting the CLIENT_BLOCKED flag.
 * 3) It puts the client into a list of just unblocked clients that are
 *    processed ASAP in the beforeSleep() event loop callback, so that
 *    if there is some query buffer to process, we do it. This is also
 *    required because otherwise there is no 'readable' event fired, we
 *    already read the pending commands. We also set the CLIENT_UNBLOCKED
 *    flag to remember the client is in the unblocked_clients list.
 *
 * processUnblockedClients() is called inside the beforeSleep() function
 * to process the query buffer from unblocked clients and remove the clients
 * from the blocked_clients queue.
 *
 * replyToBlockedClientTimedOut() is called by the cron function when
 * a client blocked reaches the specified timeout (if the timeout is set
 * to 0, no timeout is processed).
 * It usually just needs to send a reply to the client.
 *
 * When implementing a new type of blocking opeation, the implementation
 * should modify unblockClient() and replyToBlockedClientTimedOut() in order
 * to handle the btype-specific behavior of this two functions.
 * If the blocking operation waits for certain keys to change state, the
 * clusterRedirectBlockedClientIfNeeded() function should also be updated.

 *   requests if the blocking request is not served). Also we put the client
 *   in a dictionary (db->blocking_keys) mapping keys to a list of clients
 *   blocking for this keys.
 * - If a PUSH operation against a key with blocked clients waiting is
 *   performed, we mark this key as "ready", and after the current command,
 *   MULTI/EXEC block, or script, is executed, we serve all the clients waiting
 *   for this list, from the one that blocked first, to the last, accordingly
