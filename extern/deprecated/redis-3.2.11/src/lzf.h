 * If the output buffer is not large enough or any error occurs return 0,
 * otherwise return the number of bytes used, which might be considerably
 * more than in_len (but less than 104% of the original size), so it
 * makes sense to always use out_len == in_len - 1), to ensure _some_

 * even different runs, thus might result in different compressed strings
 * depending on the phase of the moon or similar factors. However, all
 * these strings are architecture-independent and will result in the
 * original data when decompressed using lzf_decompress.
 *
 * The buffers must not be overlapping.

 * If the option LZF_STATE_ARG is enabled, an extra argument must be
 * supplied which is not reflected in this header file. Refer to lzfP.h
