=======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.

Redis 3.2.11     Released Thu Sep 21 15:47:53 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Potentially critical bugs fixed.

AOF flush on SHUTDOWN did not cared to really write the AOF buffers
(not in the kernel but in the Redis process memory) to disk before exiting.
Calling SHUTDOWN during traffic resulted into not every operation to be
persisted on disk.

Oran Agra (and also Buğra Gedik) in commit 8651e5d5:
 Flush append only buffers before existing.

Redis 3.2.10     Released Fri Jul 28 17:49:07 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: This release contains a number of fixes that are not
                          critical in the general case, but quite important
                          in certain use cases. Upgrading is suggested but not
                          mandatory.

Dear Redis users,

while 4.0.1 is already out, this is a maintenance release of Redis 3.2.
It fixes several bugs, the most interesting ones are the following:

1. INFO server.stat_net_output_bytes field was computed in a wrong way, now
   the output is correct.
2. SET with EX/PX options are now propagated correctly in the AOF, using
   the absolute times.
3. CLIENT PAUSE was fixed to prevent eviction of keys, so that master and
   slave continue to be consistent for the time the pause is active.
4. GEORADIUS(BYMEMBER)_RO variants for read-only operations added.
5. HyperLogLog sanity detection fixed in an edge case.
6. Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of hidden node flags fixed.

If you think you may be affected by the above problems, upgrading is a
good idea.

Have a nice day,
Salvatore

Redis 3.2.8     Released Sun Feb 12 16:11:18 CET 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release reverts back the Jemalloc upgrade
                          that is believed to potentially cause a server
                          deadlock. A MIGRATE crash is also fixed.

Two important bug fixes, the first of one is critical:

1. Apparently Jemalloc 4.4.0 may contain a deadlock under particular
   conditions. See https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3799.
   We reverted back to the previously used Jemalloc versions and plan
   to upgrade Jemalloc again after having more info about the
   cause of the bug.

2. MIGRATE could crash the server after a socket error. See for reference:
   https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3796.

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.7     Released Tue Jan 31 16:21:41 CET 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes important security and correctness
                      issues. It is especially important to upgrade for Redis
                      Cluster users and for users running Redis in their laptop
                      since a cross-scripting attack is fixed in this release.

Main bugs fixes and improvements in this release:

1. MIGRATE could incorrectly move keys between Redis Cluster nodes by turning
   keys with an expire set into persisting keys. This bug was introduced with
   the multiple-keys migration recently. It is now fixed. Only applies to
   Redis Cluster users that use the resharding features of Redis Cluster.

2. As Redis 4.0 beta and the unstable branch already did (for some months at
   this point), Redis 3.2.7 also aliases the Host: and POST commands to QUIT
   avoiding to process the remaining pipeline if there are pending commands.
   This is a security protection against a "Cross Scripting" attack, that
   usually involves trying to feed Redis with HTTP in order to execute commands.
   Example: a developer is running a local copy of Redis for development
   purposes. She also runs a web browser in the same computer. The web browser
   could send an HTTP request to http://127.0.0.1:6379 in order to access the
   Redis instance, since a specially crafted HTTP requesta may also be partially
   valid Redis protocol. However if POST and Host: break the connection, this
   problem should be avoided. IMPORTANT: It is important to realize that it
   is not impossible that another way will be found to talk with a localhost
   Redis using a Cross Protocol attack not involving sending POST or Host: so
   this is only a layer of protection but not a definitive fix for this class
   of issues.

3. A ziplist bug that could cause data corruption, could crash the server and
   MAY ALSO HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS was fixed. The bug looks complex to
   exploit, but attacks always get worse, never better (cit). The bug is very
   very hard to catch in practice, it required manual analysis of the ziplist
   code in order to be found. However it is also possible that rarely it
   happened in the wild. Upgrading is required if you use LINSERT and other
   in-the-middle list manipulation commands.

4. We upgraded to Jemalloc 4.4.0 since the version we used to ship with Redis
   was an early 4.0 release of Jemalloc. This version may have several
   improvements including the ability to better reclaim/use the memory of
   system.

Redis 3.2.6     Released Tue Dec 06 09:33:29 CET 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: GEORADIUS, BITFIELD and Redis Cluster minor fixes.

This release mainly fixes three bugs:

1. A bug with BITFIELD that may cause the bitmap corruption when setting offsets
   larger than the current string size.

2. A GEORADIUS bug that may happen when using very large radius lengths, in
   the range of 10000km or alike, due to wrong bounding box calculation.

3. A bug with Redis Cluster which crashes when reading a nodes configuration
   file with zero bytes at the end, which sometimes happens with certain ext4
   configurations after a system crash.

Redis 3.2.4     Released Mon Sep 26 08:58:21 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 3.2 and unstable contained a security
                          vulnerability fixed by this release.

Hello Redis Wizards of the Memory Stores Empire,

this is a Redis critical release in order to fix a security issue
which is documented clearly here:

    https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6d9f8e2462fc2c426d48c941edeb78e5df7d2977

Thanks to Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos for reporting the issue.

IMPACT:

The gist is that using CONFIG SET calls (or by manipulating redis.conf)
an attacker is able to compromise certain fields of the "server" global
structure, including the aof filename pointer, that could be made pointing
to something else. In turn the AOF name is used in different contexts such
as logging, rename(2) and open(2) syscalls, leading to potential problems.

Please note that since having access to CONFIG SET also means to be able
to change the AOF filename (and many other things) directly, this issue
actual real world impact is quite small, so I would not panik: if you
have CONFIG SET level of access, you can do more and more easily.

AFFECTED VERSIONS:

All Redis 3.2.x versions are affected.

OTHER CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE:

This release also includes other things:

* TCP binding bug fixed when only certain addresses were available for
a given port.

* A much better crash report that includes part of the Redis binary:
this will allow to fix bugs even when we just have a crash log and
no other help from the original poster oft the issue.

* A fix for Redis Cluster redis-trib displaying of info after creating
a new cluster.

Please check the following list of commits for credits about who did what.
Thanks to all the contributors and a special thank to Oran Agra for the
help in this release.

Redis 3.2.3     Released Tue Aug 02 10:55:24 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Fix replication delay and redis-cli security issue.

Hello,

this is a minor release of Redis addressing two bugs:

1. There was an inverted if statement logic problem in replication.c causing
   a replication delay. This is not an actual problem since things work
   as expected, but worth to fix ASAP anyway.

2. Redis-cli created the history file with insecure permissions, allowing
   reding from the file. This was actually a bug in linenoise which is
   now fixed. The applied fix is from Chris Lamb.

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.2     Released Thu Jul 28 14:14:54 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A Redis server and a Sentinel crash are now fixed.
                          GEORADIUS errors in reported entries are fixed.

Hi all! Redis 3.2.2 is finally out with non trivial bugfixes and a few new
features. Let's start from the bugs:

1. There was a bug in the List type implementation, able to cause the
   crash of the server under certain (non trivial to replicate) circumstances
   when the LSET command was used. Now the bug is fixed and a new stress tester
   that was able to easily trigger the bug was added to the test suite.

2. Redis Sentinel, when monitoring multiple masters, could crash after
   a Sentinel address update event.

3. Redis Sentinel now checks slaves INFO state more often when disconnected.
   This is not really a bug fix, but may allow to more easily detect that
   a slave is able to fail over its master reducing certain delays.

4. It was possible, under a variety of conditions, that the AOF and RDB children
   process could spawn at the same time. This is known to trash disk I/O,
   AOF performances, and to ultimately create latency in the Redis server.
   Normally Redis avoids to have the two writing children at the same time, but
   there were edge cases discovered by Oran Agra (that also co-authored the
   fix with me) where the double-fork could happen. In order to fix this bug
   non trivial changes to the replication code were operated, however it was
   important to back port this fix into 3.2.2 because the bug could lead to
   bad latency experiences in certain cases.

5. Many GEORADIUS bugs are now fixed \o/. This started as a failing CI
   test. I grepped for more clues and there were a number of random failures
   in the points reported by GEORADIUS. The errors were found to be related
   to three different bugs (one of these was a bug in the test itself).
   It's not a critical bug: the effect is to, sometimes, don't report objects
   that are near the radius, but only with specific sets of coordinates
   and radius settings. However now the issues are fixed and the error
   vectors were added as regression tests.

And now the good news (not that bug fixes are not good...), that is, the
new features!

1. Now slaves support the slave-announce-ip and slave-announce-port options.
   Using these features a slave can be reported by the master `INFO` output
   and `ROLE` command as having arbitrary IP and port. This allows to have
   Sentinel deployments when working with containers or NAT-ed environments
   more easily.

2. The RDB check utlity is now part of Redis and uses the same RDB code that
   Redis uses in order to load the dataset in memory, so a given version
   of Redis is always able to check the RDB it produced... without another
   external check tool which is supposed to be taken in sync with the
   rdb.c implementation. This in turn also means that the new RDB checking
   is able to spot more complex bugs, since it really loads the dataset
   instead of just skipping bytes.

About the redis-check-dump utility, now it is also able to show certain
information about the RDB file, like the version that produced it, when
it was produced, and so forth. Example:

    ./redis-check-rdb dump.rdb
    [offset 0] Checking RDB file dump.rdb
    [offset 32] AUX FIELD redis-ver = '3.2.2'
    [offset 46] AUX FIELD redis-bits = '64'
    [offset 58] AUX FIELD ctime = '1469710178'
    [offset 73] AUX FIELD used-mem = '1186528'

The ability to check how much memory was used by the instance that produced
the RDB file can be especially useful.

For credits and the full change log, see the list of commits below, that was
modified in order to be a bit less verbose compared to the last releases.

Enjoy!
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.1     Released Fri Jun 17 15:01:56 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Critical fix to Redis Sentinel, due to 3.2.0 regression
                      compared to 3.0.

Hey, this is Redis 3.2.1, and this release should bring some grain of
maturity to Redis 3.2. The list of commits following this note will tell
you the details, but the main things addressed in this release are the
following:

1. A critical bug in Sentinel was hopefully fixed. During the big 3.2
   refactoring of Redis Sentinel, in order to implement connection sharing
   to make Sentinel able to scale better (few Sentinels to monitor many
   masters), a bug was introduced that mis-counted the number of pending
   commands in the Redis link. This in turn resulted into an inability to talk
   with certain Redis instances. A common result of this bug was the inability
   of Redis Sentinel to reconfigure back the old master, after a failover,
   when it is reachable again, as the slave of the new master. This was due
   to the inability to talk with the old master at all.

2. BITFIELD bugs fixed.

3. GEO commands fixes on syntax errors and edge cases.

4. RESTORE now accepts dumps generated by older Redis versions.

5. Jemalloc now is really configured to save you memory, for a problem a
   change in the jemalloc configuration did not really survived when the
   3.2.0 release was finalized.

6. TTL and TYPE command no longer alter the last access time of a key, for
   LRU evictions purposes. A new TOUCH command was introduced *just* to
   update the access time of a key.

7. A bug was fixed in redis-cli, that connected to the instance running on the
   port 6379 if there was one, regardless of what was specified.

8. TCP keep alive is now enabled by default. This should fix most ghost
   connections problems without resulting in any practical change in otherwise
   sane deployments.

9. A Sentinel crash that could happen during failovers was fixed.

And of course, more minor things that you can read in the detailed log
below. There are still reported bugs for 3.2 that were not fixed in this
release, but nothing critical AFAIK, and I wanted to release this one ASAP,
so likely a new release will not be too far.

Enjoy,
Salvatore

| Fix Sentinel pending commands counting.
| By antirez, 2016-06-16 19:24:34 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6ad0371c9b4206a7a6692d50c9a301457baf9b6d

This bug most experienced effect was an inability of Redis to
reconfigure back old masters to slaves after they are reachable again
after a failover. This was due to failing to reset the count of the
pending commands properly, so the master appeared fovever down.

Was introduced in Redis 3.2 new Sentinel connection sharing feature
which is a lot more complex than the 3.0 code, but more scalable.

Many thanks to people reporting the issue, and especially to
@sskorgal for investigating the issue in depth.

Hopefully closes #3285.

| redis-cli: really connect to the right server.
| By antirez, 2016-06-16 17:23:31 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/58f1d446c35e8fe62df7c9ebe10f3c40a386c022

I recently introduced populating the autocomplete help array with the
COMMAND command if available. However this was performed before parsing
the arguments, defaulting to instance 6379. After the connection is
performed it remains stable.

The effect is that if there is an instance running on port 6339,
whatever port you specify is ignored and 6379 is connected to instead.
The right port will be selected only after a reconnection.

Close #3314.

| RESTORE: accept RDB dumps with older versions.
| By antirez, 2016-06-16 15:53:57 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/f592b4d3178963878084a522b4fd050772c335ae

Reference issue #3218.

Checking the code I can't find a reason why the original RESTORE
code was so opinionated about restoring only the current version. The
code in to `rdb.c` appears to be capable as always to restore data from
older versions of Redis, and the only places where it is needed the
current version in order to correctly restore data, is while loading the
opcodes, not the values itself as it happens in the case of RESTORE.

For the above reasons, this commit enables RESTORE to accept older
versions of values payloads.

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/16102bc0af0912a0c9a92aedddf796eb24a80b9e

I'm the author of this line but I can't see a good reason for it to
don't be a typo, a step of 26 should be valid with 52 bits per
coordinate, moreover the line was:

    if (step > 26) step = 25;

So a step of 26 was actually already used, except when one of 27 was
computed (which is invalid) only then it was trimmed to 25 instead of
26.

All tests passing after the change.

Probably there is no compiler that will actaully break the code or raise
a signal for unsigned -> signed overflowing conversion, still it was
apparently possible to write it in a more correct way.

All tests passing.

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.0     Released Fri May 06 08:47:10 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: 3.2-RC users should upgrade ASAP to this more
                      stable release of Redis.

Hello, this is Redis 3.2.0 stable! And with the new release there is a new
format for the changelog. Now it is composed of a "letter" like the one
you are reading, followed by all the commits composing the release for people
interested in the details.

There are a few changes between the latest release candidate of Redis 3.2
and the final 3.2.0 release. The main ones are the obvious bug fixes you
can find detailed below, also a few new things:

Critical bugs fixed:

* There was a problem in the way a cluster instance loaded the AOF that
  could cause data written via scripts to be lost during reshardings.

New things:

* There is a new very powerful BITFIELD command. Check the documentation
  here: http://redis.io/commands/BITFIELD

* CONFIG GET is allowed during the loading of the dataset.

* The DEBUG command have new features and can show an help with DEBUG HELP.

* redis-cli show hits about the commands arguments to the right.

* GEORADIUS got a STORE / STOREDIST option to store the result into a target
  key (as as orted set) instead of reporting it to the user.

* Redis Cluster replicas migration now works in a slightly different way. In
  the past a slave could migrate only to a master that used to have slaves
  in the past (and if there was still trace of this information). Now instead
  if a new slave gets at least a slot, and at least one other master in the
  cluster has a slave, then the new master is considered a valid target for
  replica migration. So if it will be orphaned and there is a spare slave
  it will get one.

* CLUSTER SLOTS output now includes the node ID (in a backward compatible
  manner).

* A lot of bug fixes you can read in the commits details below, with the
  authors that kindly provided many useful patches. Thanks.

As usually what "stable" means is that we are confident the release is mature,
however do your tests before putting it into production in your environemnt
as it's fresh meat anyway.

Cheers,
Salvatore

This reverts commit 1189a4eae6d009fc0da8d50fd542ba1391542165.

Actually this is wrong, the command can be called without args at all.

This fixes a bug introduced by d827dbf, and makes the code consistent
with the logic of always allowing, while the cluster is down, commands
that don't target any key.

As a side effect the code is also simpler now.

I've renamed maxmemoryToString to evictPolicyToString since that is
more accurate (and easier to mentally connect with the correct data), as
well as updated the function to user server.maxmemory_policy rather than
server.maxmemory. Now with a default config it is actually returning
the correct policy rather than volatile-lru.

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/38cf2bd257d09b360be6adf450d59592a359696d

The test works but is very slow so far, since it involves resharding
1/5 of all the cluster slots from master 0 to the other 4 masters and
back into the original master.

| New masters with slots are now targets of migration if others are.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/7b618823c189c24313effbccda7022d167ea419c

This fixes issue #3043.

Before this fix, after a complete resharding of a master slots
to other nodes, the master remains empty and the slaves migrate away
to other masters with non-zero nodes. However the old master now empty,
is no longer considered a target for migration, because the system has
no way to tell it had slaves in the past.

This fix leaves the algorithm used in the past untouched, but adds a
new rule. When a new or old master which is empty and without slaves,
are assigend with their first slot, if other masters in the cluster have
slaves, they are automatically considered to be targets for replicas
migration.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/0b69c9865619b54b75576e67aaafe7b018734bec

This fix was suggested by Anthony LaTorre, that provided also a good
test case that was used to verify the fix.

The problem with the old implementation is that, the time returned by
a timer event (that is the time after it want to run again) is added
to the event *start time*. So if the event takes, in order to run, more
than the time it says it want to be scheduled again for running, an
infinite loop is triggered.

| By antirez, 2016-02-25 23:31:45 +0100
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/761a77287107ce53dbf4755f1435cc9660b6c86d

The new bitfield command is an extension to the Redis bit operations,
where not just single bit operations are performed, but the array of
bits composing a string, can be addressed at random, not aligned
offsets, with any width unsigned and signed integers like u8, s5, u10
(up to 64 bit signed integers and 63 bit unsigned integers).

The BITFIELD command supports subcommands that can SET, GET, or INCRBY
those arbitrary bit counters, with multiple overflow semantics.

Trivial and credits:

A similar command was imagined a few times in the past, but for
some reason looked a bit far fetched or not well specified.
Finally the command was proposed again in a clear form by
Yoav Steinberg from Redis Labs, that proposed a set of commands on
arbitrary sized integers stored at bit offsets.

Starting from this proposal I wrote an initial specification of a single
command with sub-commands similar to what Yoav envisioned, using short
names for types definitions, and adding control on the overflow.

This commit is the resulting implementation.

Examples:

    BITFIELD mykey OVERFLOW wrap INCRBY i2 10 -1 GET i2 10

| Cluster: include node IDs in SLOTS output.

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/0f3fb0097ae70e36ee65468b79f0be4160934bb4

CLUSTER SLOTS now includes IDs in the nodes description associated with
a given slot range. Certain client libraries implementations need a way
to reference a node in an unique way, so they were relying on CLUSTER
NODES, that is not a stable API and may change frequently depending on
Redis Cluster future requirements.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OLD STYLE CHANGELOG ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC3 (version 3.1.103) ] Release date: 28 jan 2016

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: this release fixes a non trivial Sentinel crash.

* [FIX] avg_ttl reporting in INFO improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] Sentinel: improve handling of known Sentinel instances.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo, thanks to Paweł Kowalczykf or the original
         crash report).
* [FIX] Redis Cluster address update (via gossip section) processing improved
        to avoid initiating inwanted handshakes.

--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC2 (version 3.1.102) ] Release date: 25 jan 2016

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: this release fixes important Redis Cluster bugs.

* [FIX] Many fixes to MIGRATE multiple keys implementation. The command
        could handle errors in a faulty way leading to crashes or other
        unexpected behaviors. MIGRATE command refactoring.
        (The analysis of the faulty conditions was conducted by
         Kevin McGehee. The fix was developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] A Redis Cluster node crash was fixed because of wrong handling of
        node->slaveof pointers.
        (Reported by JackyWoo, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] Fix redis-trib rebalance when nodes need to be left empty because
        the specified weight is zero.
        (Reported by Shahar Mor, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] MIGRATE: Never send -ASK redirections for MIGRATE when there are
        open slots. Redis-trib and other cluster management utility must
        always be free to move keys between nodes about open slots, in order
        to reshard, fix the cluster configuration, and so forth.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] Lua debugger crash when printing too deeply nested objects.
        (Reported by Paul Kulchenko, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] Redis-cli implementation of Lua debugging now allows to use the
        SCRIPT DEBUG command directly, switching to debugging mode as needed.
        (Reported by Paul Kulchenko, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [FIX] Redis-trib is now able to fix more errors. A new CLUSTER subcommand
        called BUMPEPOCH was introduced in order to support new modes
        for the "fix" subcommand. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Redis proctected mode: this feature improves Redis security and makes
        harder to run Redis in a configuration that is unsecure because no
        firewalling was used in order to protect Redis from external accesses.
        See this Reddit post for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3zv85m/new_security_feature_redis_protected_mode/ (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Cluster/Sentinel tests now use OSX leak to perform leak detection
        at the end of every unit. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Detect and show server crashes during Cluster/Sentinel tests.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] More reliable Cluster/Sentinel test becuase of timing errors and
        -LOADING errors. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)

--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC1 (version 3.1.101) ] Release date: 23 dec 2015

This is the first release candidate of Redis 3.2. The changelog above shows
what's new in this release. In the next of the following weeks we'll test
in depth every feature and we'll release new RCs as bugs are discovered
and fixed. Note that while 3.2 looks solid already, it contains many changes
to its internals. It's still fresh code compared to 3.0.

General changes:

* [NEW] Lua scripts "effect replication". Makes possible to write scripts
        with side effects, use of random commands, and so forth.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Lua scripts selective replication. Makes possible to replicate to
        slaves and AOF only selected parts of a script. (Design by
        Yossi Gottlieb and Salvatore Sanfilippo, implemented by Salvatore)
* [NEW] Geo indexing support via GEOADD, GEORADIUS and other commands.
        See http://redis.io/commands/geoadd for more information.
        (Initially implemented in a fork of Redis called "Ardb".
         Matt Stancliff "imported back" the work to Redis and created the
         initial API and implementation. Salvatore Sanfilippo modified
         the API and the implementation, fixed bugs, improved performances
         and unified the duplicated code with t_zset.c)
* [NEW] Lua debugger. A complete stepping, remote debugger for Lua scripts.
        Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvRfStaoyM
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo with many feedbacks and testing from
         Itamar Haber)
* [NEW] SDS improvements for speed and maximum string length.
        This makes Redis more memory efficient in different use cases.
        (Design and implementation by Oran Agra, some additional work
         by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Modify Jemalloc size classes to make certain Redis objects fit
        better, improving memory efficiency. (Oran Agra)
* [NEW] Better consistency behavior between masters and slaves for expired
        keys. The slaves are only able to logically consider a key expired
        even before receiving the `DEL` command from the master. This avoids
        the delay there is sometimes between the natural expire of the key
        and the moment the slave is notified. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Support daemon supervision by upstart or systemd (Pierre-Yves Ritschard)
* [NEW] New encoding for the List type: Quicklists. Very important memory
        savings and storage space in RDB gains (up to 10x sometimes).
        (Design and implementation by Matt Stancliff. RDB storage reworked
         by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] SPOP with optional count argument. (Initial implementation by
        Alon Diamant, mostly reimplemented by Salvatore Sanfilippo for speed
        and in order to make the replication of a this class of commands,
        having as logical effect the execution of multiple commands, possible).
* [NEW] Support for RDB AUX fields. Now RDB files contain additional info
        like the creation date, version of Redis generating it and so forth.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Faster RDB loading via the RESIZEDB opcode to avoid useless hash tables
        rehashings. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] HSTRLEN command. (@landmime and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] CONFIG SET/GET implementations refactored, partially rewritten,
        now exposing more config options. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] CLUSTER NODES major speedup. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] CLIENT KILL TYPE MASTER, to kill (disconnect) masters from slaves.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Jemalloc updated to 4.0.3 (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] DEBUG RESTART/CRASH-AND-RECOVER [delay] (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] CLIENT REPLY command implemented: ON, OFF and SKIP modes.
        (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Crash report produced by Redis on crash improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] Better memory test on crash. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)

Redis Cluster changes:

All the Redis Cluster changes in 3.2 were backported to 3.0, so there is
technically nothing new for now in this release. The most important things
are:

* Cluster rebalancing.
* A pipelined MIGRATE command which is 10x faster and makes resharding
  and rebalancing faster.
* Improved replicas migration.
* As a side effect of quicklists encoding (see above items), moving big
  lists between nodes is now a lot faster.

Redis Sentinel changes:

* [NEW] Sentinel connection sharing. Makes Sentinels able to scale to
        monitor many masters. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* [NEW] New SENTINEL INFO-CACHE command. (Matt Stancliff)
* More things backported to Redis 3.0 in the past, so no longer news of 3.2.

Migrating from 3.0 to 3.2
=========================

Redis 3.0 is mostly a strict subset of 3.2, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.0 to 3.2. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 3.2 release:

* The default configuration file now binds to 127.0.0.1.
* Slaves try to no longer expose stale data about already expired keys.
* The RDB format changed. Redis 3.2 is still able to read 3.0 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.
* Behavior on crash may be different. The crash log format changed and
  the memory test executed is now different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is
provided. Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Redis Labs for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.

Commit messages may contain additional credits.

Cheers,
Salvatore
