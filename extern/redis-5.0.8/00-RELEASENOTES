Redis 5.0.7     Released Tue Nov 19 17:52:44 CET 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: many issues fixed, some may have an impact.

Hi all, Redis 5.0.7 fixes a number of bugs, none is very critical, however
there are a few that may have an impact. It's a good idea to upgrade.
There are fixes in the area of replication from modules commands and
callbacks, AOF fsync (non critical issue), memory leaks (very rare and small),
streams beahvior (non critical), and a potential crash in commands
processing multiple keys at the same time that is there for years, and happens
very rarely, but is not impossible to trigger.

The following is the list of commits in this release.

Redis 5.0.6     Released Wed Sep 25 12:33:56 CEST 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Only in case of exposed instances to untrusted users.

This Redis release, 5.0.6, is a bugfix and enhancement release. The most
important bugfix is a corruption related to the HyperLogLog. A malformed
HyperLogLog string could cause an invalid access to the memory. At a first
glance the vulnerability appears to be not exploitable but just a DoS. The
way to trigger the issue is complex, we'll not provide any information about
how to do that for the users safety.

Other significant changes in this release:

* New modules APIs merged from Redis unstable to Redis 5.
* Some memory optimization related to objects creation.
* Fixes to flushSlaveOutputBuffer() that make sure that SHUTDOWN will
  transfer pending buffers to replicas.

Redis 5.0.5     Released Wed May 15 17:57:41 CEST 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes an important AOF fysnc bug
                          and other less critical issues.


Dear user,

Redis 5.0.5 fixes an important issue with AOF and adds multiple very useful
modules APIs. Moreover smaller bugs in other parts of Redis are fixed in
this release.

The AOF bug
-----------

The AOF bug happens when the fsync policy is set to "everysec", which is the
default: if the write load in the server drops immediately, the commands
executed in the latest second may not be fsync-ed to disk as it should.
This may lead to data loss in case the write load drops immediately and
successively a server crash happens.

Other things in this release
----------------------------

* Streams: a bug in the iterator could prevent certain items to be returned in
           range queries under specific conditions.
* Memleak in bitfieldCommand fixed.
* Modules API: Preserve client->id for blocked clients.
* Fix memory leak when rewriting config file in case of write errors.
* New modules API: RedisModule_GetKeyNameFromIO().
* Fix non critical bugs in diskless replication.
* New mdouels API: command filtering. See RedisModule_RegisterCommandFilter();
* Tests improved to be more deterministic.
* Fix a Redis Cluster bug, manual failover may abort because of the master
  sending PINGs to the replicas.

The following is the full list of commmits.

Regards,
Salvatore

Redis 5.0.4     Released Mon Mar 18 17:12:53 CET 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes several Redis stability issues.

Dear Redis users, this release includes a number of fixes for bugs that may
result in Redis crashing in special conditions (not normal usage, but specific
artificial conditions), fixes to certain Redis behaviors especially around
Redis streams, and finally a set of new APIs for Redis Modules.

Specifically:

* Hyperloglog different coding errors leading to potential crashes were fixed.
* A replication bug leading to a potential crash in case of plain misuse of handshake commands was fixed.
* XCLAIM command incrementing of number of deliveries was fixed.
* LFU field management in objects was improved.
* A potential overflow in the redis-check-aof was fixed.
* A memory leak in case of API misuse was fixed.
* ZPOP* behavior when count is 0 is fixed.
* A few redis-cli --cluster bugs were fixed, plus a few improvements.
* Many other smaller bugs.

We suggest to upgrade Redis, especially in case your instance is facing
untrusted users (for instance Cloud providers) because several of these
bugs could result in unwanted crashes.

Redis 5.0.3     Released Tue Dec 11 18:17:26 CET 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Redis 5 is consolidating, upgrading is a good idea.
                      However there is nothing very critical here, but certain
                      issues resolved could lead to very rare crashes.

Welcome to Redis 5.0.3, several interesting bug fixes here:

* Redis no longer panics when you send data to a replica-mode connection that
  is in MONITOR or SYNC mode.

* Fixes to certain sorted set edge cases. You are unlikely to ever notice those
  issues, but now it is more correct.

* Certain BSD variants now are better supported: build & register logging
  on crash.

* The networking core now recovers if an IPv6 address is listed in bind but
  is actually not able to work because there is no such protocol in the
  system.

* redis-cli cluster mode improved in many ways. Especially the fix subcommand
  work was enhanced to cover other edge cases that were still not covered
  after the work done for Redis 5.

* MEMORY USAGE is now more accurate.

* DEBUG DIGEST-VALUE added in case you want to make sure a given set of keys
  (and not the whole DB) are excatly the same between two instances.

* Fix a potential crash in the networking code related to recent changes
  to the way the reply is consumed.

* Reject EXEC containing write commands against an instance that changed role
  from master to replica during our transaction.

* Fix a crash in KEYS and other commands using pattern matching, in an edge
  case where the pattern contains a zero byte.

* Fix eviction during AOF loading due to maxmemory triggered by commands
  executed in loading state.

The following is the list of commmits if you want to check credits or dig
further in the details.

commit 2c6ee0f9b3d9ca48c6da8bd18796186784216bff
Author: antirez <antirez@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 12 11:37:15 2018 +0100

    freeMemoryIfNeeded() small refactoring.

    Related to issue #5686 and PR #5689.

commit 107e93e75acfd5def0252efb6870751940816395
Author: zhaozhao.zz <zhaozhao.zz@alibaba-inc.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 12 00:25:24 2018 +0800

    evict: don't care about mem if loading

    When loading data, we call processEventsWhileBlocked
    to process events and execute commands.
    But if we are loading AOF it's dangerous, because
    processCommand would call freeMemoryIfNeeded to evict,
    and that will break data consistency, see issue #5686.

Redis 5.0.2     Released Thu Nov 22 11:22:37 CET 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency: CRITICAL if you use streams and consumer groups.
                 HIGH if you use redis-cli with Redis Cluster.
                 LOW otherwise.

Welcome to Redis 5.0.2. This release fixes two issues with Streams consumer
groups, where items could be returned duplicated by XREADGROUP when accessing
the history, and another bug where XREADGROUP can report some history even
if the comsumer pending list is empty. Both problems were addressed and unit
tests to avoid regressions implemented. Moreover this release fixes some
issue with redis-cli when in cluster mode. Finally some FreeBSD and DragonFly
build problems are now resolved. The list of the commits is below.

Enjoy,
Salvatore

Redis 5.0.1     Released Wed Nov 07 13:09:30 CET 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency: URGENT if you use Redis Streams. MODERATE otherwise.

Hi all, this is the first patch level release of Redis 5. It contains
both fixes and improvements. Here there is a list of the major ones, however
read the commit messages at the end of the changelog if you want to know
more about the smaller things. Let's start with the new features:

* Sentinel now supports authentication! Check the Sentinel official doc
  for more info.

* Redis-cli cluster "fix" is now able to fix a big number of clusters put
  in a bad condition. Previously many corner cases were not covered.

Now the critical fixes:

1. Fix RESTORE mismatch reply when certain keys already expired.
2. Fix an XCLAIM non trivial issue: sometimes the command returned a wrong
   entry or desynchronized the protocol.

And now the other fixes:

3. Stack trace generation on the Raspberry PI (and 32bit ARM) fixed.
4. Don't evict expired keys when the KEYS command is called, in order to
   avoid a mass deletion event. However expired keys are not displayed
   by KEYS as usually.
5. Improvements in the computation of the memory used, when estimating
   the AOF buffers.
6. XRANGE COUNT of 0 fixed.
7. "key misses" stats accounting fixed. Many cache misses were not counted.
8. When in MULTI state, return OOM while accumulating commands and there
   is no longer memory available.
9. Fix build on FreeBSD and possibly others.
10. Fix a crash in Redis modules, thread safe context reply accumulation.
11. Fix a race condition when producing the RDB file for full SYNC.
12. Disable protected mode in Sentinel.
13. More commands now have the HELP subcommand.
14. Fixed an issue about adaptive server HZ timer.
15. Fix cluster-replica-no-failover option name.

Finally, this is the list of commits. Enjoy Redis 5.0.1!

Redis 5.0.0     Released Wed Oct 17 13:28:26 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several fixes to streams AOF and replication.

Hi all and welcome to the first stable release of Redis 5! \o/

To start a quick recap of what's new in Redis 5:

1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
   inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
    - Better propagation of Lua scripts to replicas / AOF.
    - Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the replica as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.

However the list above really does not do justice to the changes of Redis 5
since the core was improved in many ways during the development of the new
version. However certain changes were back ported into Redis 4 once they were
sensed as safe, because many improvements were hard to distinguish from fixes.

The most important user facing improvement is without doubts the introduction
of the new general purpose data type after years: the streams.

Note that we worked to improve and fix streams till a few hours ago, so while
we are not aware of critical bugs in this release, surely there is to handle it
with some care for the first weeks. Bug reporting will be highly appreciated and
we are ready to work immediately to release 5.0.1 once there is enough important
stuff to justify a new release (probably soon).

People not using the streams can have probably a better production-ready
experience with Redis 5, also because many internals are shared with Redis 4
so the jump is not as big as it was between 3.2 and 4 in terms of how things
internally work.

Well, many thanks to the Redis community and the developers that made
this release possible, contributing bug reports, patches, new features, working
on the clients, sometimes debugging problems for days. Also thank to everybody
that adopted Redis for their use cases making things work for users worldwide.

The list of commits in this release follows.

Cheers,
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 5.0-rc6     Released Wed Oct 10 11:03:54 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed especially in the context of streams.

This is probably the last release candidate of Redis 5. The Redis 5 GA version
will be released 17th of October. The main highlights of this release are:

* Critical AOF bug, as old as AOF itself: if an open MULTI/EXEC block is at
  the end of the AOF file, Redis would still read the half-transaction when
  reloading back the AOF.
* The slave name was removed from logs and documentation, now replica is used
  instead.
* LOLWUT command added.
* New modules APIs: Disable Redis Cluster redirection.
* New modules APIs: Sorted dictionaries data type.
* Modules APIs fixes: timer / cluster messages callback now can call RM_Call().
* Fix for #5024 - commandstats for multi-exec were logged as EXEC.
* A number of optimizations and fixes for the stream data type.
* Many other stability improvements.

This is the list of comments and contributors:

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC5     Released Thu Sep 06 12:54:29 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several imporant bugs fixed.

Hi all,

This is the release candidate number five, and has a lot of bug fixes inside,
together with a few big changes to the Redis behavior from the point of view
of replication of scripts and handling of the maxmemory directive in slaves.
Make sure to read the whole list!

* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Slaves now ignore maxmemory by default.
* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Now scripts are always replicated for their effects, and
                     never sending the script itself to slaves/AOF.
* Improvement: Big pipelining performances improved significantly.
* Fix: Rewrite BRPOPLPUSH as RPOPLPUSH to propagate.
* Fix: False positives in tests.
* Fix: Certain command flags were modified because not correct.
* Fix: Fix blocking XREAD for streams that are empty.
* Improvement: Allow scripts to timeout on slaves as well.
* Fix: Different corner cases due to CLIENT PAUSE are now fixed.
* Improvement: Optimize parsing large bulk greater than 32k.
* Fix: Propagate read-only scripts as SCRIPT LOAD, not as EVAL.

The following is the list of commits, so that you can read the details and
check the credits of the commits.

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC4     Released Fri Aug 03 13:51:02 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency

    HIGH: Many non critical but important issues fixed.
    CRITICAL for Stream users: Many important bugs fixed.

Hi all, welcome to Redis 5.0 RC4.

This release is a huge step forward in Redis 5 maturity and fixes a number
of issues. It also provides interesting improvements. Here I'll summarize
the biggest one, but laster you can find the full list of commits:

Fixes:

* A number of fixes related to Streams: stability and correctnes.
* Fix dbRandomKey() potential infinite loop.
* Improve eviction LFU/LRU when keys are created by INCR commands family.
* Active defragmentation is now working on Redis 5.
* Fix corner case in Redis CLuster / Sentinel failover, by resetting the
  disconnection time with master in a more appropriate place.
* Use a private version of localtime() to avoid potential deadlocks.
* Different redis-cli non critical fixes.
* Fix rare replication stream corruption with disk-based replication.

Improvements:

* Sentinel: add an option to deny online script reconfiguration.
* Improved RESTORE command.
* Sentinel command renaming: allows to use Sentinel with Redis instances
  that have non standard command names.
* CLIENT ID and CLIENT UNBLOCK.
* CLIENT LIST now supports a TYPE option.
* redis-cli --cluster now supports authentication.
* redis-trib is now deprecated (use redis-cli --cluster).
* Better slaves output buffers efficiency.
* Faster INFO when there are many clients connected.
* Dynamic HZ feature.
* Improvements in what the MEMORY command is able to report.
* Add year in log. (WARNING: may be incompatible with log scraping tools)
* Lazy freeing now works even when values are overwritten (for instance SET).
* Faster ZADD when elements scores are updated.
* Improvements to the test suite, including many new options.

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC3     Released Wed Jun 14 9:51:44 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW:

This release fixes compilation of Redis RC2. For an error the commit from unstable
updating the Rax library was not merged into the 5.0 branch.

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC2     Released Wed Jun 13 12:49:13 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes important security issues.
                    HIGH: This release fixes a SCAN commands family bug.
                MODERATE: This release fixes a PSYNC2 edge case with expires.
                MODERATE: Sentinel related fixes.
                     LOW: All the other issues

NOTE: This release breaks API compatibility with certain APIs that were
introduced in Redis 5.0 RC1. Notably ZPOP* now returns score/element in reverse
order. XINFO <key> special form was removed, now XINFO STREAM <key> must be
used to obtain general information about the stream.

Redis 5.0 RC2 ixes a number of important issues:

* Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
  Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017
  for more information.

* A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return all the elements.
  We also add a regression test that can trigger the issue often when present, and
  may in theory be able to find unrelated regressions.

* A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving RDB files
  because otherwise it is no longer possible to use such RDB file as a base
  for partial resynchronization. It no longer represents the right state.

* Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is disabled.

* Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect that the master
  was down immediately. A delay was added to the detection.

* XREADGROUP would crash when the master had attacked slaves.

* Replication and events generation of several streams command were fixed.

* XREVRANGE fixed, in some cases it could not return elements, or crash the
  server, or in general not behave correctly.

* ZPOP can now unblock multiple clients in a sane way.

* Other minor issues.

Moreover this release adds new features:

* XGROUP DESTROY and XGROUP SETID.

* RDB loading speedup.

* Configurable stream macro node limits (number of elements / bytes).

* More smaller improvements.

The following is the list of commits composing the release, please check
the commit messages and authors for credits.

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC1   Released Tue May 29 14:14:11 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 5.

Introduction to the Redis 5 release
===================================

Redis 5 is a release focused on a few important features. While Redis 4
was very very focused on operations, Redis 5 changes are mostly user-facing,
with the implementation of new data types and operations on top of existing
types. The following are the major features of this release:

1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
   inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
    - Better propagation of Lua scripts to slaves / AOF.
    - Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the slave as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.

Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

Migrating from 4.0 to 5.0
=========================

Redis 4.0 is mostly a strict subset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 4.0 to 5.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 5.0 release:

* redis-cli now implements the cluster management tool. We still ship the
  old redis-trib, but new fixes will be implemented only in redis-cli.
  See `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 5.0 is still able to read 4.0 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 5.0.

* Now by default maxmemory is ignored by slaves, and used only once a slave
  is promoted to master. It means that in setups where you want slaves to
  enforce maxmemory in an independent way from the master (that will anyway
  stream the key eviction DEL commands), you should active this feature manually
  and make sure you understand that it breaks consistency if writes are not
  always idempotent. TLDR: the new behavior is much better for 99.999% of use
  cases, revert it if you really know what you are doing.

* Scripts are only replicated by their *effects* and not by sending EVAL/EVALSHA
  to slaves or the AOF log itself. This is much better in the general case
  and in the future we want to totally remove the other possiblity of
  propagating scripts the old way (as EVAL). However you can still turn this
  back to the default via the non-documented (if not here) Redis configuration
  directive "lua-replicate-commands yes" or
  "DEBUG lua-always-replicate-commands 0". However note that Redis 6 may
  completely remove such feature.

* Because of the above change related to scripts replication, certain Redis
  commands that in Redis 4 had their result ordered lexicographically before
  being passed to Lua via the return value of redis.call(), now have a behavior
  more similar to calling the commands directly from a normal client. For
  instance the ordering of elements returned by SMEMBERS or SDIFF is now
  undetermined in Lua, exactly as it is by default when calling the commands
  from a non-scripting context.
